# this is all about object oriented programming.
# o o p is  a way to make objects in the ccode.
# objects is nothing but it is derived from the name class tab.
# classes - template
# onject - letter - instance of the class
# DRY - do not repeat yourself
#  time money and effort got save if we choose this type of programming in our coding life.
# TIME MONEY AND EFFORT

# go and start OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMIN IN THE NEXT VEDIO CLASSES

# ENCAPSULATION: wrapping or binding up of variables(data_ and methods(code) into a single unit which is useful for security.

# CLASS: That boundary name is class. all the encapsulation we are doing will be done inside the class.
# class provies the definition of the object.
# collection od objects.
# it definnes bject.

# OBJECT: class and onject are interrrelated with each other.
# it is also called a sample.
# class is imaginary and object is real thing.
# collection of objects is nothing but a class.

# DATA ABSTRACTION: representiong essential features without including background details.

# INHERITANCE: deriving a new class from already exxisting class.

# POLYMORPHISM:  many forms.
# an operation exibits different behaviours in different instances.
